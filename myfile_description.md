# Level up Project

Level Up is my project's personal passion project that I have been thinking about for some time. In my journey learning development there have been a lot of strategies and techniques that I have learned and utilized
to deal with motivation, discipline, habit building and goal planning. I have shared what I have learned with people in different coding learning communities since people are commonly challenged to stay motivated,
to maintain discipline, to build good study habits and effectively plan for their goals. I have implemented my versions of these different strategies and techniques using Google sheets, Notion and just plain
post-it notes but it wasn't  a  great experience tracking activities across different apps and mediums. I started to think about an app that could put all of this together in one cohesive  interface and would allow
you to do so in a fun and engaging manner.
